Project Title: Comprehensive Spring Boot CRUD Application

Description:
Engineered a feature-rich Spring Boot application leveraging advanced architectural patterns and industry best practices.
The project encompasses a one-to-many relationship, a robust exception handling mechanism, and a modular structure including DAO, DTO, service, controller, exception, and repository packages.
Developed using the Spring Tool Suite (STS), the application seamlessly performs CRUD operations and has been extensively tested using Postman API.

Key Contributions:

One-to-Many Relationship:

Established a well-defined one-to-many relationship, optimizing data management and retrieval capabilities.
Exception Handling:

Implemented a sophisticated Exception Handler class to gracefully manage and report exceptions, enhancing user experience and debugging efficiency.
Data Access Object (DAO) Layer:

Developed a streamlined DAO layer, encapsulating database interactions for clean and efficient data access.
DTO (Data Transfer Object):

Utilized DTOs to ensure smooth data transfer between layers, fostering a clear and organized communication structure.
Service Layer:

Designed a robust service layer that encapsulates business logic, ensuring separation of concerns and promoting modular development.
Controller Layer:

Implemented RESTful API endpoints in the controller layer to handle incoming requests, facilitating seamless communication with the service layer.
Exception Management:

Incorporated a dedicated exception package to manage application-specific exceptions, maintaining a consistent and controlled error-handling mechanism.
Repository Layer:

Leveraged Spring Data JPA for the repository layer, providing a simplified and efficient interface for database interactions.
Testing with Postman API:

Thoroughly tested the application's functionality using Postman API, ensuring the reliability and correctness of CRUD operations.
